# HealthTracker — Decision Log

Ruled implementation contracts. The brief (`CLAUDE.md`) says **what** and **why**; this log says exactly **how**, as ruled. Both bind equally. Entries are append-only and dated; once ruled, supersede with a new entry rather than editing an old one, so the audit trail survives.

## D1 — Storage key naming (2026-07-11)

Version-stable key `healthtracker-log` with `{ version: 1, ... }` inside the blob. The predecessor baked the version into the *key* (`uha-log-v1`), which is precisely why a future "v2" would orphan v1 data. Schema bumps migrate in place under this one stable key; nothing is ever orphaned.

## D2 — Migration precedence: idempotent, one-directional (2026-07-11)

- On boot, read `healthtracker-log`. **If present, it wins unconditionally** — the migrator does not run, does not read legacy, does not merge or "refresh," regardless of what `uha-log-v1` looks like.
- **Only when `healthtracker-log` is absent** do we read `uha-log-v1`, migrate it, and write the new blob stamped with `migratedFrom: "uha-log-v1"` and `migratedAt: <ISO timestamp>`.
- Legacy `uha-log-v1` is left **untouched** (read-only) as a rollback copy.
- **Memory-mode edge case:** if the new-key *write* keeps failing (memory mode / quota), then `healthtracker-log` stays absent and the migrator will re-read legacy on the next load. That's correct, not the resurrection this rule guards against — there were no durable new-app edits to lose, since nothing persisted. The "resurrect stale data after a week" failure mode requires successful new-key writes to have happened, and once one has, the new key exists and legacy is never consulted again.

## D3 — Pre-restore backup: durable key + visible surface (2026-07-11)

- On destructive Import/restore: **before** overwriting, write the outgoing blob to `healthtracker-log-prerestore` (single rolling slot = "undo the last restore") **and** render it into a visible, copyable `<textarea>` on the page. Confirm-gate stays.
- **No clipboard** as the backup mechanism — gesture-gated, fails silently, and the user's next paste destroys it.
- **Degraded path:** if the `-prerestore` write itself fails (memory mode / quota), we will **not** claim it's backed up. The confirm dialog degrades to "storage can't hold a backup — copy the on-screen text below first," and the visible copyable surface becomes the sole recovery path. Same truthful-badge philosophy: never assert safety we don't have.
