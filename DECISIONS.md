# HealthTracker — Decision Log

Ruled implementation contracts. The brief (`CLAUDE.md`) says **what** and **why**; this log says exactly **how**, as ruled. Both bind equally. Entries are append-only and dated; once ruled, supersede with a new entry rather than editing an old one, so the audit trail survives.

## D1 — Storage key naming (2026-07-11)

Version-stable key `healthtracker-log` with `{ version: 1, ... }` inside the blob. The predecessor baked the version into the *key* (`uha-log-v1`), which is precisely why a future "v2" would orphan v1 data. Schema bumps migrate in place under this one stable key; nothing is ever orphaned.

## D2 — Migration precedence: idempotent, one-directional (2026-07-11)

- On boot, read `healthtracker-log`. **If present, it wins unconditionally** — the migrator does not run, does not read legacy, does not merge or "refresh," regardless of what `uha-log-v1` looks like.
- **Only when `healthtracker-log` is absent** do we read `uha-log-v1`, migrate it, and write the new blob stamped with `migratedFrom: "uha-log-v1"` and `migratedAt: <ISO timestamp>`.
- Legacy `uha-log-v1` is left **untouched** (read-only) as a rollback copy.
- **Memory-mode edge case:** if the new-key *write* keeps failing (memory mode / quota), then `healthtracker-log` stays absent and the migrator will re-read legacy on the next load. That's correct, not the resurrection this rule guards against — there were no durable new-app edits to lose, since nothing persisted. The "resurrect stale data after a week" failure mode requires successful new-key writes to have happened, and once one has, the new key exists and legacy is never consulted again.

## D3 — Pre-restore backup: durable key + visible surface (2026-07-11)

- On destructive Import/restore: **before** overwriting, write the outgoing blob to `healthtracker-log-prerestore` (single rolling slot = "undo the last restore") **and** render it into a visible, copyable `<textarea>` on the page. Confirm-gate stays.
- **No clipboard** as the backup mechanism — gesture-gated, fails silently, and the user's next paste destroys it.
- **Degraded path:** if the `-prerestore` write itself fails (memory mode / quota), we will **not** claim it's backed up. The confirm dialog degrades to "storage can't hold a backup — copy the on-screen text below first," and the visible copyable surface becomes the sole recovery path. Same truthful-badge philosophy: never assert safety we don't have.

## D4 — Migration is lossless; supplement backfill is a separate, optional Phase-1 utility (2026-07-11)

Migration is a **transport layer and must never editorialize**. Migrated days are byte-faithful to the export; the auto-supplement is **not** retro-injected inside the migrator — doing so would break the lossless gate (see Phase 0 gate) and blur what "migrated" means.

**Known consequence, recorded so it does not die silently:** the predecessor's export defect dropped the daily supplement, so migrated history sits ~5 kcal/day and — more materially — **~4 g/day soluble fiber below truth**, with a small step discontinuity in the fiber averages where new-app days (which persist the supplement at creation) begin. Fiber is a watched metric here, so this correction is flagged, not paved over.

**The fork in the road:** the correction, if wanted, is an **optional one-time backfill utility** — a Phase-1 candidate, built and committed *separately* from migration:
- a distinct, explicit operation, never part of boot or migration;
- injects the daily supplement into selected historical days;
- items flagged `_auto: true` **and** `backfilled: true` (identifiable, and distinguishable from natively-created supplement items);
- reversible and confirm-gated;
- whether to run it is the user's call at the time it exists.

Build the fork; do not pave over it.
